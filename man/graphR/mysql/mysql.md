# mysql

MySQL (/ˌmaɪˌɛsˌkjuːˈɛl/) is an open-source relational database management system (RDBMS).
 Its name is a combination of "My", the name of co-founder Michael Widenius's daughter My,
 and "SQL", the acronym for Structured Query Language. A relational database organizes data 
 into one or more data tables in which data may be related to each other; these relations 
 help structure the data. SQL is a language that programmers use to create, modify and extract
 data from the relational database, as well as control user access to the database. In 
 addition to relational databases and SQL, an RDBMS like MySQL works with an operating system 
 to implement a relational database in a computer's storage system, manages users, allows 
 for network access and facilitates testing database integrity and creation of backups.
