        <h3>Description</h3>

        <p>The connection parameter for the MYSQL database server.
 
 (MySQL服务器的远程连接参数)</p>

<h4>Using MySqlCommand</h4>

<p>A MySqlCommand has the CommandText And CommandType properties associated With it. 
 The CommandText will be handled differently depending On the setting Of 
 CommandType. 
 
 CommandType can be one Of:</p>

<p>+ Text -An SQL text command (default)
 + StoredProcedure -The name of a Stored Procedure
 + TableDirect -The name of a table (New in Connector/Net 6.2)</p>

<p>The Default CommandType, Text, is used For executing queries And other SQL commands. 
 Some example Of this can be found In the following section Section 4.1.2, 
 <strong>“The MySqlCommand Object”</strong>.</p>

<p>+ If CommandType Is set to StoredProcedure, set CommandText to the name of the Stored Procedure to access.
 + If CommandType Is set to TableDirect, all rows And columns of the named table 
   will be returned when you call one of the Execute methods. In effect, 
   this command performs a SELECT * on the table specified. The CommandText property 
   Is set to the name of the table to query. This Is illustrated by the 
   following code snippet

<pre><code class="vbnet"> ' ...
 Dim cmd As New MySqlCommand()
 cmd.CommandText = "mytable"
 cmd.Connection = someConnection
 cmd.CommandType = CommandType.TableDirect
 Dim reader As MySqlDataReader = cmd.ExecuteReader()

 Do While (reader.Read())
     Call Console.WriteLine(reader(0), reader(1)...)
 Loop
 ' ...
</code></pre>


 
 Examples of using the CommandType of StoredProcedure can be found in the section 
 Section 5.10, “Accessing Stored Procedures with Connector/Net”.
 Commands can have a timeout associated With them. This Is useful As you may Not 
 want a situation were a command takes up an excessive amount Of time. 
 A timeout can be Set Using the CommandTimeout Property. The following code snippet
 sets a timeout Of one minute:

<pre><code class="vbnet"> Dim cmd As New MySqlCommand()
 cmd.CommandTimeout = 60
</code></pre>


 
 The Default value Is 30 seconds. <em></em>Avoid a value Of 0, which indicates an indefinite
 wait.<em></em> To change the Default command timeout, use the connection String 
 Option Default Command Timeout.
 Prior to MySQL Connector/Net 6.2, MySqlCommand.CommandTimeout included user processing 
 time, that Is processing time Not related To direct use Of the connector. 
 Timeout was implemented through a .NET Timer, that triggered after CommandTimeout seconds.
 This timer consumed a thread.
 MySQL Connector/Net 6.2 introduced timeouts that are aligned With how Microsoft Handles 
 SqlCommand.CommandTimeout. This Property Is the cumulative timeout 
 For all network reads And writes during command execution Or processing Of the results.
 A timeout can still occur In the MySqlReader.Read method after the first 
 row Is returned, And does Not include user processing time, only IO operations. 
 The 6.2 implementation uses the underlying stream timeout facility, so Is more 
 efficient In that it does Not require the additional timer thread As was the Case With 
 the previous implementation.</p>

        <h3>Declare</h3>        

        <pre>
            <code id="clr_ts">
# namespace Oracle.LinuxCompatibility.MySQL.Uri
export class ConnectionUri {
   # <code>Using &lt;database_name></code>.
   Database: string;
   # the file path of the error log file, null or empty string means default error log file in temp filesystem.
   error_log: string;
   # The server IP address, you can using <code>localhost</code> to specific the local machine.
   IPAddress: string;
   Password: string;
   # The port number of the remote database server.
   Port: integer;
   # 这个属性会在链接字符串之中设置查询超时的选项，单位为秒：
   # 
   # <pre><code class=""> default command timeout={TimeOut};
   # </code></pre>
   # 
   # 
   #  
   #  + 假若这个参数值为负数，则不会进行设置，默认值为-1，为负值，则默认不会设置超时选项，即使用默认的超时设置30秒
   #  + 假若这个参数值为0，则会被设置为无限等待
   TimeOut: integer;
   User: string;
}
</code>
        </pre>
